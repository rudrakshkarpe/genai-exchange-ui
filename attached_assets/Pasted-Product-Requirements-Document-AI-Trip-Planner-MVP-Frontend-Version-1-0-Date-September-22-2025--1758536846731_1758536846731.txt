Product Requirements Document: AI Trip Planner (MVP Frontend)
Version: 1.0
Date: September 22, 2025
Author: Brainstormer AI

1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) frontend of the AI Trip Planner. The goal is to build a clean, modern, and responsive web interface that serves as the primary interaction layer for the powerful agentic AI backend. For this version, the focus is exclusively on the core conversational planning experience.

2. Core User Experience
The user's journey is simple: they visit the web app, start a conversation with the AI planner, and see their trip itinerary come to life in real-time.

User Stories:

As a traveler, I want to type my trip ideas into a chat box and get instant, intelligent responses.

As a planner, I want to see the generated trip itinerary displayed clearly next to my conversation.

As a user, I want the application to feel fast, intuitive, and inspiring to use.

3. Key Features (MVP Scope)
3.1. Main Application Layout
Structure: A two-panel layout. The left (main) panel will be the Chat Interface (approx. 65% of the width). The right panel will be the Itinerary Display (approx. 35% of the width).

Header: A simple, clean header containing the application logo on the top-left.

3.2. Feature: Conversational Chat Interface
Chat Display: A scrollable window showing the conversation history.

User messages: Right-aligned, simple text bubbles.

AI responses: Left-aligned, perhaps with a small icon next to the bubble.

Input Area: A fixed input area at the bottom of the chat panel.

Text Field: A standard text input field with a placeholder like "Tell me about your dream trip to..."

Send Button: A clear, clickable button to submit the text.

Voice Input (Placeholder): A microphone icon must be present next to the send button. For this MVP, it should be visually disabled (e.g., grayed out) and non-functional.

3.3. Feature: Dynamic Itinerary Display
Purpose: To visually represent the trip plan as it's being built by the AI. This panel is read-only for the user in this version.

Structure:

Trip Title: Display the trip destination and dates at the top (e.g., "5-Day Adventure in Kerala").

Day Cards: The itinerary should be organized into cards, one for each day.

Card Content: Each card should have a clear title (e.g., Day 1: Arrival in Kochi) and a chronological list of activities (e.g., 9:00 AM: Explore Fort Kochi, 1:00 PM: Lunch at a local cafe).

Behavior: This panel must dynamically update whenever the backend provides a new itinerary structure. It should smoothly render the new day cards or activities without a full page refresh.

4. Design and UI/UX Guidelines
Overall Vibe: Modern, minimalist, and adventurous. The design should feel clean and spacious, putting the focus on the conversation and the beautiful itinerary.

Color Palette:

Primary Background: Off-white or very light gray (#F8F9FA).

Accent Color: An energetic and optimistic color for buttons, links, and highlights. A vibrant blue (#007BFF) or a warm coral (#FF7F50) would work well.

Text: A dark, highly readable charcoal gray (#212529).

Typography:

Font: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font family like Inter or Poppins (available from Google Fonts).

Hierarchy: Use distinct font sizes and weights for headings (itinerary title, day numbers) and body text (chat messages, activity descriptions).

Logo: The provided logo file should be placed in the top-left of the application header. Ensure it is sized appropriately and has adequate clear space around it.

5. Technical Requirements & Backend Interaction
Scope: This project is for the frontend application only. The backend will be developed and connected separately.

Framework: The application should be built using a modern JavaScript framework like React.

API Interaction:

The frontend must be structured to communicate with a backend API.

A primary API call will be made when the user sends a chat message. This call will send the user's text.

The expected API response should be a JSON object containing two keys:

"chat_response": A string with the AI's text message to be displayed in the chat.

"itinerary_data": A structured JSON object representing the entire updated itinerary for the Itinerary Display panel.

For development, a mock API function should be created that returns sample JSON data in the expected format to allow for UI development without a live backend.

State Management: Utilize a state management solution (e.g., React Context or Zustand) to handle the itinerary state, ensuring the Itinerary Display panel re-renders efficiently when the state is updated by an API response.

6. Out of Scope for this Version
To ensure focus, the following features are explicitly excluded from this MVP release:

User accounts, login, or profiles.

Saving or sharing itineraries.

Any manual editing of the itinerary (e.g., drag-and-drop).

Interactive maps, dashboards, or mood boards.

Booking or payment integrations.
